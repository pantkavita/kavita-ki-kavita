                    <h1>Year of Nurse and Midwife </h1>
                    <p>DATE:-07  Apr 2020</p>
                <p>World Health Day is celebrated on April 07 every year.This year the theme of International Health Day is "Year of the nurse and midwife".As we know that this time the whole world is suffering from the pandemic of covid-19 and this time our doctors ,nurses and also midwife are doing a great work.
                    They are working all day and also in night and giving their hundred percent to save our life.They weighied their whole life for us.But some people of India are still not understanding their contribution and their sacrifice for the nation.
                    This year WHO gave them a small tribute for their work in this pandemic time.</br>
                   <b> "Nurses are the unsung heroes of the covid-19 .The invaluable role they have played in testimony of their sacrifice ,courage and commitment to a healthier and safer world"
                                                                                         -WHO</b></br>
                    As above said nurses are the unsung heroes in this tough  time.I also appreciate the work of doctors and midwife.I feel very proud to be a citizen of India ,where all come together when there is any calamity over nation.
                    These unsung heroes are the real heroes who leaved their family to perform their duty for the nation.
                    Through this article I just want to thank all the doctors,nurses and midwife to work so hard in this tough time.
