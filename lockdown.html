                    <h1>The two sides of "LOCKDOWN"</h1>
                    <p>DATE:-13 Sept 2020</p>
                <p>A virus which forces us to live in a lockdown,whose threat is greater than the any fear of human being,is CORONA virus.
                    In this period of lockdown and also in the process of Unlock,we saw two sides of corona virus- one is negative and another one is positive.
                   <br><b> Negative side :-</b>Due to the corona virus the regular cycle of human being got disturbed.School ,colleges,transport system,temples,malls etc.are closed.We are living in our house as locked from more than 06 months.
                    There are lots of people who commited suicide also get depressed due to this unbelievable lockdown.There are some people who are currently suffering from the problem of anxiety.In this lockdown  a lot of families are facing some financial crisis.
                    Due to the online classes,50% of students are suffering from eye sight problem,back and neck problem and also they are losing their interests from studies. 
                  <br><b>  Positive side :-</b>As every coin has always two sides -Head and Tail same in our life every situation has two phases,it depends on us how we treat them.
                    On 22nd March and 05th April,I saw a unique brotherhood and unity in India.These days became remarkable in my life. In this tough time people are giving moral and ethical support to each other.They are giving a new track to their life by making it healthy.
                    They are doing yoga,eating healthy food and making their lifestyle healthy.This period give a break to the environment to rejuvenate itself.This period taught us that life is not a race so give a break to yourself and live some moment with your family and spend some time in the lap of nature.
